My name is Jared Sutton, I have bachelor's degrees in physics and mathematics, and I'm an aspiring software engineer. 
Personally, im particularly interested in ML and AI, as well as exploring both their viable technical use cases, as well as, more broadly, their potential sociopolitical/socioeconomic implications. 
Ultimately, I would like to help develop methods for communicating relevant information about ML/AI to laypersons so that they can make more informed, and less biased decisions about such technology.
