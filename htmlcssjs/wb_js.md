# Javascript Workbook
## Exercises
This time, we'll have multiple mini projects that you can progress in your own pace
### 1. Fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz is a small program that takes in a positive integer n and prints the following for all positive integer less than or equal to n, in ascending order
- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
- If the number is divisible by 15, print "FizzBuzz"
- If number is not divisible by 3, 5, or 15, then print the number itself

### 2. Calculator

## Conceptual Questions

- What are some common data types in js?

string, number, boolean, object

- What does it mean for js to be weakly typed?

it implicitly makes assumptions about variable data types, and tries type coercion rather than throwing errors about some type mismatches.

- (T/F) Javascript derived from java

False. It was basically a marketing ploy.

- What is the difference between == and ===?

`x==y` applies even if `y` and `x` are the same 'value' but of different types, whereas `x===y` applies only if they are exactly the same value.

- what does it mean for a variable to have function scope?

Its value can only be accessed inside whatever function it's defined in.

- What are different ways of creating variables in js? What are the differences?
    - `const` - doesnt allow the value to change
    - `let` - allows the value to change (min scope is block scope)
    - `var` - outdated, but similar to `let` (min scope is function scope)

- What is DOM?



- What is an event handler?



- How do we create array in js?



- how do we create js objects?



- (T/F) javascript object is JSON
